**Frogger type game for Udacity Front End Nanodegree**

### The game is won by moving your Hero with the keyboard arrow keys to collect all the jewels without a bug squishing you. 
### If a bug squishes you then your Hero will be moved back to start and the game is reset.
### If you make it to the water the Hero pauses for a moment (setTimeout) and then moves back to start. 
### If you collect all three jewels you win and the game resets.
