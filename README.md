# Olson-Udacity-Arcade-Game
Frogger type game for Udacity Front End Nanodegree

-The game is won by moving your Hero with the keyboard arrow keys from the grass to the water without a bug squishing you. 
-If a bug squishes you then your Hero will be moved back to start.
-If you make it to the water the Hero pauses for a moment (setTimeout) and then moves back to start. 
-As soon as I've caught up with my classmates in this Nanodegree I plan to return to this project and add all the bells and whistles to make it a jewel-collecting game with a timer and points assigned. 
-Good luck and have fun!
